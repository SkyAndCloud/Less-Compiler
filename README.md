# Less-Compiler

This is a compiler which compile `less` code to `css` code. I just write it in `C` for a try to SeedCup2015.

## ToDo
1. Output as a css file(it just output a variable tree now).
2. improve my code style and structure.

## Features
1. Delete notes like `//some notes`
2. Variable rule(`int`, `float`, `pixel`,`string`, `color`)
3. Calculate rule(include **color**, **pixel**, **numbers**, and inserting **string**)
4. Nest rule
5. Scope rule

## Usage
After compiling this code, you can just type `./less_compiler src_less des_css` to make it run.

## Bugs
Because it's just a demo and supports just a little features, I'm sure there is many bugs though I have tested a lot.
